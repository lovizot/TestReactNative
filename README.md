### Requirements attended

- Drawer using styles as the GIF;
- Used typescript;
- Created some few components using interfaces to describe props;
- Used some good practiced as useCallback, and useRef to keep things organized;

- Split the code in many more components;
- Use ContextAPI to manage those animations throughout the app;
- Create Tab Stack to the navigation (react-navigation);
- Create global styles and apply a theme;
